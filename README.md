Introduction
Collaborative Filtering is a technique which is widely used in recommendation systems and is rapidly advancing research area. The two most commonly used methods are memory-based and model-based.

In this project , I created model which are userd (User-Based Collaborative Filtering) and (Popularity Based Filtering ). The main idea behind UBCF is that people with similar characteristics share similar taste. For example, if you are interested in recommending a movie to our friend Suraj, suppose Suraj and I have seen many movies together and we rated them almost identically. It makes sense to think that in future as well we would continue to like similar movies and use this similarity metric to recommend movies.

Second approch is Popularity based work on popularity idea, for example in Hollywood there are so many movies but few are best and worth to watch. avatar, FF series, Marvels, DC are example of Poppularity based filtering.
